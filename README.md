## Overview

`wildRtrax` (pronounced *wild-R-tracks*) is an R package containing functions to help manage and analyze environmental sensor data. It helps to simplify the entire data life cycle by offering tools for data pre-processing, wrangling, and analysis, facilitating seamless data transfer to and from [WildTrax](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home.html). With `wildRtrax`, users can effortlessly establish end-to-end workflows and ensure reproducibility in their analyses. By providing a consistent and organized framework, the package promotes transparency and integrity in research, making it effortless to share and replicate results.

## Installation

You can install `wildRtrax` directly from this repository with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildRtrax")
```

## Usage

All functions begin with a `wt_*` prefix. Column names and metadata align with the WildTrax infrastructure. The goal is to follow the work flow of pre-processing, linking with WildTrax, download and analysis. Some functions are built specifically for ARUs :sound:, cameras :camera: or point counts :bird:, while others are used for all sensors. :bat: denotes ultrasonic functionalities.
