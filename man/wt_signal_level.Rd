\title{Get signals from specific windows of audio}
\usage{
wt_signal_level(
  path,
  fmin = 500,
  fmax = NA,
  threshold,
  channel = "left",
  aggregate = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the wav file}

\item{fmin}{The frequency minimum}

\item{fmax}{The frequency maximum}

\item{threshold}{The desired threshold}

\item{channel}{Choose "left" or "right" channel}

\item{aggregate}{Aggregate detections by this number of seconds, if desired}
}
\value{
A list object containing the following four elements: output (dataframe), aggregated (boolean), channel (character), and threshold (numeric)
}
\description{
Signal level uses amplitude and frequency thresholds in order to detect a signal.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
df <- wt_signal_level(path = "")
}
