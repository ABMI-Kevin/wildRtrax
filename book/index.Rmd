![](assets/cover.png)

`wildRtrax` (pronounced *‘wilder tracks’*) is an R package to help ecologists create full-cycle environmental sensor data work flows. 

## Who is this book for?

This book is a valuable resource for anyone working with environmental sensor data and seeking to manage it using R. It is suitable for both experienced users and those new to the subject, as it is written in a clear and accessible style. While the book is designed to be user-friendly, it also contains advanced concepts and functions that may require additional reading to fully understand. The authors encourage readers to engage and provide feedback, as the book and workflows will continue to evolve. The content relies on understand of the following R packages:

* [`tidyverse`]() mainly `dplyr` and `purrr` for data tidying and functional programming
* [`fs`]() for file reading
* [`lubridate`]() for dealing with dates and times
* [`sf`]() for mapping spatial objects

## How should I read this book?

For any given sensor, the general workflow is outlined below and how this book fits into the bigger picture of environmental sensor data management. 

1. **Understanding the basics**
2. Collecting data
3. **Data pre-processing** 
4. Data processing 
5. **Data analysis**
6. Reporting

## Impact and intentions

`wildRtrax` strives to maintain independent, scientifically credible, relevant, accessible, and transparent language and code. By doing so, we hope to provide unbiased and accurate information products that are easily understood by anyone. Our values are grounded in leadership, accuracy, ingenuity, passion, personal initiative and teamwork in the field of environmental sensor data as we seek to inspire ecologists to engage in responsible resource management. Our team values personal initiative and teamwork, and we encourage learning, feedback, to its shared success. We are passionate about our work and the impact it has on the environment, and we continuously work to fuel better products and processes through innovative ideas.
