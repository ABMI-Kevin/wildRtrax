# Preface {-}

`wildRtrax` (pronounced *‘wilder tracks’*) is an R package to help environmental sensor data users to create full-cycle work flows from data management to analytics.

## Who is this book for?

This book is a valuable resource for anyone working with environmental sensor data and seeking to manage it using R. It is suitable for both experienced users and those new to the subject, as it is written in a clear and accessible style. While the book is designed to be user-friendly, it also contains advanced concepts and functions that may require additional reading to fully understand. The authors encourage readers to engage and provide feedback, as the book and workflows will continue to evolve. The content relies on understand of the following R packages:

* [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) mainly `dplyr` and `purrr` for data tidying and functional programming
* [`fs`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/01/fs-1.0.0/) for file system operations
* [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) for dealing with dates and times
* [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for simple features mapping

## How should I read this book?

To effectively use this book to manage environmental sensor data, follow these steps:

For any given environmental sensor, the general workflow is outlined below and how this book fits into the bigger picture of environmental sensor data management. 

1. [**Understanding the basics**](#acoustic-data-management-basics)
2. Collecting data
3. [**Data pre-processing**](#acoustic-data-pre-processing)
4. [Data processing](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home/resources/guide/acoustic-data/acoustic-tagging-methods.html) and [verification](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home/resources/guide/acoustic-data/species-verification.html) using WildTrax
5. [**Data analysis**](#acoustic-data-analysis)
6. Reporting

To effectively read this book, keep the following tips in mind:

* Start with the basics and build upon them as you progress through the book.
* Use the headings to guide your reading and keep you organized.
* Take notes and jot down questions as you read to ensure that you fully understand the concepts and techniques presented.
* Review the information periodically to reinforce your understanding and keep the information fresh in your mind.
