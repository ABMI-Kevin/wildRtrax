MacPhail, Marcus Becker, Elly C. Knight 2023-03-14 Preface wildRtrax (pronounced ‘wilder tracks’) is an R package to help environmental sensor data users to create full-cycle work flows from data management to analytics. 0.1 Who is this book for? This book is a valuable resource for anyone working with environmental sensor data and seeking to manage it using R. It is suitable for both experienced users and those new to the subject, as it is written in a clear and accessible style. While the book is designed to be user-friendly, it also contains advanced concepts and functions that may require additional reading to fully understand. The authors encourage readers to engage and provide feedback, as the book and work flows will continue to evolve with the software. The content relies on understand of the following R packages: tidyverse mainly dplyr and purrr for data tidying and functional programming fs for file system operations lubridate for dealing with dates and times sf for simple features mapping 0.2 How should I read this book? For any given environmental sensor, the general workflow is outlined below and how this book fits into the bigger picture of environmental sensor data management. To effectively use this book to manage environmental sensor data, follow these steps: Understanding the basics Collecting data Data pre-processing Data processing and verification using WildTrax Data analysis Reporting Keep the following tips in mind as well: Start with the basics and build upon them as you progress through the book. Use the sidebar menu to guide your reading and keep you organized Review the information periodically to reinforce your understanding and keep the information fresh in your mind The Did you know? sections will provide additional information about a function or work flow. The Keep in mind sections will warn you when there is something you should think about before running a function or designing a study, for example. 0.3 What is WildTrax? WildTrax is a web-enabled portal designed to manage, store, process, share and discover environmental sensor data and the biological data extracted from the media. WildTrax was developed by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. wildRtrax serves as a parallel design and indicator to WildTrax for future analytics and functionalities. 0.4 Why did you build wildRtrax? By outlining a standardized and harmonized procedure for data intake, quality control, processing and verification of acoustic data from autonomous recording units (ARUs), wildRtrax and WildTrax hope to provide open work flows for using ARUs to answer meaningful biological questions in order to inform conservation and decision-making. Developing parallel-track design between an R package and a web-enabled software like WildTrax can significantly improve the software development process. It allows for simultaneous development and testing of both applications, reducing the chances of errors and incompatibilities, and formalizing data structures and APIs across a network of different applications. 0.5 Impact and intentions wildRtrax strives to maintain independent, scientifically credible, relevant, accessible, and transparent language and code. By doing so, we hope to provide unbiased and accurate information products that are easily understood by anyone. Our values are grounded in leadership, accuracy, ingenuity, passion, personal initiative and teamwork in the field of environmental sensor data as we seek to inspire users to engage in responsible resource management. Our team values personal initiative and teamwork, and we encourage learning, feedback, to its shared success. We are passionate about our work and the impact it has on the environment, and we continuously work to fuel better products and processes through innovative ideas. You can visit the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute for more information. 0.6 Installing the package You can install wildRtrax directly from this repository with: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;ABbiodiversity/wildRtrax&quot;) Or the development version with: remotes::install_github(&quot;ABbiodiversity/wildRtrax@development&quot;) 0.7 Usage All functions begin with a wt_* prefix. Column names and metadata align with the WildTrax infrastructure. The goal is to follow the work flow of pre-processing, linking with WildTrax, download and analysis. 0.8 Acknowledgements The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute supports and funds all operations surrounding wildRtrax and WildTrax. Many thanks to Dr. Richard Hedley for providing the basis for the wt_wac_info internal function for wac file support. "]]
