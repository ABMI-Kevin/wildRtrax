MacPhail, Marcus Becker, Elly C. Knight 2023-03-14 Preface wildRtrax (pronounced ‘wilder tracks’) is an R package to help environmental sensor data users to create full-cycle work flows from data management to analytics. 0.1 Who is this book for? This book is a valuable resource for anyone working with environmental sensor data and seeking to manage it using R. It is suitable for both experienced users and those new to the subject, as it is written in a clear and accessible style. While the book is designed to be user-friendly, it also contains advanced concepts and functions that may require additional reading to fully understand. The authors encourage readers to engage and provide feedback, as the book and work flows will continue to evolve with the software. The content relies on understand of the following R packages: tidyverse mainly dplyr and purrr for data tidying and functional programming fs for file system operations lubridate for dealing with dates and times sf for simple features mapping 0.2 How should I read this book? For any given environmental sensor, the general workflow is outlined below and how this book fits into the bigger picture of environmental sensor data management. To effectively use this book to manage environmental sensor data, follow these steps: Understanding the basics Collecting data Data pre-processing Data processing and verification using WildTrax Data analysis Reporting Keep the following tips in mind as well: Start with the basics and build upon them as you progress through the book. Use the sidebar menu to guide your reading and keep you organized Review the information periodically to reinforce your understanding and keep the information fresh in your mind The Did you know? sections will provide additional information about a function or work flow.
